# Data Analysis Portfolio Project
This portfolio project contains all the projects I have worked on.
## Movie Correlation Project
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of movies to gain insights into their attributes and correlations. After performing data cleaning, including handling missing values and sorting the data by gross revenue, I conducted exploratory data analysis. By visualizing the correlation matrix, I identified relationships between movie attributes such as ratings, genres, release years, and scores. The analysis revealed interesting findings, such as a positive correlation between ratings and scores, indicating that highly rated movies tend to have higher scores. Additionally, there was a negative correlation between ratings and genres, suggesting that certain genres may be more polarizing in terms of audience reception. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and correlation analysis.
## Bank Loan Financial Analysis
I conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information on over 5000 customers. The project aimed to understand the factors influencing loan applications and customer characteristics. Key tasks included analyzing customer demographics, income levels, credit card spending, education levels, and their relationship to loan acceptance. Additionally, the project explored the usage of banking services such as securities accounts, certificate of deposit (CD) accounts, online banking facilities, and credit cards issued by the bank. The findings from this project provided valuable insights into customer behavior and can be used to inform future loan campaigns and marketing strategies.
## Interactive Dashboard on CO2 Emission by Country
I developed a captivating interactive dashboard that visualizes CO2 emissions by country. This project allowed me to delve into the intricate world of environmental data and create an engaging tool for exploring CO2 emissions trends. By leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, panel, hvplot.pandas, and holoviews, I was able to efficiently analyze and manipulate the dataset. The dashboard I created offers users the flexibility to filter and visualize CO2 emissions data based on specific countries, regions, and years of interest.
This project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and dashboard development. Through my work, I demonstrated a strong grasp of Python programming and I also honed my skills in extracting meaningful insights and presenting them in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
